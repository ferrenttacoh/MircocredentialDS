# MircocredentialDS

This repository is about the assignment I had to do in Microcredential Data Scientist by Ditjen Dikti Republic Indonesia.
I had to upload the .pdf format at this repository because some problem that I found, such as notebook taking too long to render, and the picture I had on the .ipynb file was couldn't show when I upload it to GitHub, because basically the picture on the .ipynb file are from Ditjen Dikti not from my devices so it got troubled on my repository.

In conclusion, I should upload the .pdf, but if you guys want the code and data so much, you can contact me on my e-mail: ferrenttacoh11@gmail.com with subject MCDS(number). Number means which material did you want to keep the .ipynb file and the .csv data. And fill what you need on the body email.

For example to send the email:

To: ferrenttacoh11@gmail.com
Subject: MCDS(4)
*Fill the needs on email body*


Thank you in advance.
